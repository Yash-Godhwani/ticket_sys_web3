# ticket_sys_web3
Our project is based on booking a ticket by using the Ethereum as a currency  in this project we made a prototype of a project to booking ticket of movie , train etc.  
to book these ticket we  use the payment gate-way  of ticket or easily to  get the tax of booking the ticket  our observation of this is to booking a ticket    To solve this problem 
we  use the API and language to make the smart contract of this.
 
we use the Meta-mask to get a testing of Transaction  in our ticketing system  and Hyper-lane use for redirecting of the payment gateway page for directed to this we use the hyper-lane  to get a good connectivity and get a fast transaction and secure transaction.
HYPERLANE is use to also get help of transaction  by using the concept of blockchain and using the transaction saved on many server so the user cannot be change the server

USE OF HYPERLANE:-

HYEPRLANE was built to cater to the modular future of blockchains, but what does it do for you? Read below to understand how HYPERLANE could benefit your own situation.
As a new chain/rollup you face a major bottleneck due to permissioned access to interoperability. Currently, you have to lobby interoperability teams to support your chain, but these teams can't keep up manually deploying to every new chain. User and liquidity growth on your chain suffers as you wait for these permissioned interoperability teams to deploy, if they ever do.

What if you're an app on a long-tail chain without interoperability? You're stranded from accessing new users and liquidity. You need to lobby permissioned interoperability teams to deploy on your chain. But most interoperability teams don’t even want to spend time deploying on your chain if it isn’t already big. It's a frustrating chicken-and-egg problem that hurts apps on long-tail chains. HYPERLANE  fixes this with Permission Interoperability.

Even if there is an existing interoperability solution on a chain, as an interchain app you’re limited by their roster of supported chains, slow deployment pace, and have no control over where they deploy in the future. Your growth as an interchain app is dependent on the permissioned interoperability team’s decisions.

USE OF METAMASK:-
METAMASK  provides the simplest yet most secure way to connect to blockchain-based applications. You are always in control when interacting on the new decentralized web.
 METAMASK is a popular wallet to store tokens. If you use it, you can get many benefits by using it: Secure crypto storage: You can use self-custodial wallets with which crypto funds cannot be lost due to a hack, as are many social engineering schemes that reveal multiple seed phrases on the Internet.

Crypto Swaps:  One of the most unique features of METAMASK  Wallet is the ease of carrying out transactions through centralized exchanges, automated market makers or DEX aggregators. You are now allowed peer-to-peer (P2P) swapping of crypto tokens through your wallet.

Get access to the world of dApps: METAMASK Wallet allows access to it via NFTs, DeFI platforms, ETH-based dApps, and many more. Users can also browse or buy non-fungible tokens (NFT) on web3 marketplaces like OpenSea with their METAMASK wallet. The ability to easily switch among wallets and utilise dApps has been made possible by the recent addition of support for BSC (Binance Smart Chain) and other smart contract platforms.

Secure crypto storage:  You can use self-custodial wallets with which crypto funds cannot be lost due to a hack, as are many social engineering schemes that reveal multiple seed phrases on the Internet. Just as with METAMASK, public and private keys are generated using seed phrases and they can be encrypted using passwords held by other users, providing the same layer of protection for hackers. This becomes difficult because the METAMASK code is open source. It has several features that help to make it completely safe for the users associated with METAMASK.

USES OF POLYGON:-
The Polygon network can achieve high scalability to support large users and transactions. It uses a modified version of Plasma and the PoS consensus system to achieve scale. It can process more crypto transactions quickly and cheaply, unlike other conventional blockchains. Polygon is a good choice, especially for decentralized applications that process large transaction volumes.

Polygon can achieve a higher transaction rate per second than the Ethereum network. As Polygon operates on top of Ethereum as a layer-2 scaling solution, it can reach up to 7,000 TPS, whereas Ethereum can only manage up to 45 TPS. Developers look at various factors, such as decentralization, interoperability, and security, when selecting a blockchain platform for their use. Scalability is another feature that is valuable for developers these days. Polygon can achieve enhanced scalability, which makes it appealing for dApps that require low costs and quick transactions. 


Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Advancements:-

As discussed earlier, low transaction costs and enhanced scalability are some of the vital features of Polygon. These features have greatly benefited the decentralized finance (DeFi) market and many DeFi projects are migrating to Polygon. Settling digital payments fast is vital for dApps, and Polygon offers real-time payment settlement, making it an ideal choice for DeFi apps.

Polygon can speed up payment settlements using its innovative APIs and SDKs. It evaluates credit ratings by analyzing the entire transaction ratings of its users, which can be a beneficial tool for DeFi services. Many lending applications have emerged using the Polygon network, such as Ovix, Aave, and ARCx. It has risen to become a top competitor to conventional blockchains such as BSC and Ethereum.

One of the significant advantages of DeFi is its potential to promote financial inclusion in developing regions. Traditional financial institutions often exclude large segments of the population from their programs and packages. DeFi can provide access to financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading to the unbanked. DeFi platforms like Polygon can help unbanked individuals access these services to participate in the global economy.
